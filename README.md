# pinn-harmonic-oscillator
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve Schr&ouml;dinger equations with harmonic oscillator potentials.

**1-dimensional Schr&ouml;dinger equations**
$$\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + V(x)\right)\psi(x) = E\psi(x),$$

with

$$V(x) = \frac{1}{2}\omega^2 x^2.$$

You can choose any other potential by changing the function "potential".
